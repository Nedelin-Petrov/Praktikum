            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Welcome to my photography portfolio! My name is Nedelin-Petrov, and I am passionate about capturing memories through my lens. Photography is not just my profession; it is my way of seeing and interpreting the world. Every image tells a story, and I am always on the lookout for those fleeting, magical moments that deserve to be immortalized. From the play of light and shadow to the depth of emotions in a single glance, I strive to encapsulate beauty and authenticity in every shot.</p>

                <h2>My Story</h2>
                <p>Photography has been a part of my life for over a decade. I started with a simple camera, capturing everyday moments, but soon realized that photography was more than just a hobby—it was a calling. Over the years, I have worked with countless clients, ranging from individuals seeking personal portraits to brands looking to enhance their visual presence. Whether it’s a breathtaking landscape, a lively event, or an intimate portrait session, I put my heart and soul into each project. My journey has taken me to incredible places, introduced me to amazing people, and taught me the importance of patience, perspective, and storytelling through images.</p>
